Agentic AI, or agent-based AI, involves autonomous systems with decision-making capabilities, memory, planning, and often tool use. Inspired by cognitive science and robotics, agentic AI differs from traditional AI by being stateful, autonomous, goal-directed, and interactive. Key components include perception, decision-making, action, memory, planning, and learning. Applications range from digital assistants and robotics to customer support and scientific discovery. While agentic AI offers significant advantages, it also poses challenges related to control, transparency, and resource management. Future developments are expected to enhance collaboration, memory, and human interaction.
